The goal of trendfilter is to **solve** nonparametric regression.

## Installation

You can install the development version of trendfilter from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glmgen/trendfilter")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, dev='svg'}
library(trendfilter)
library(ggplot2)
x <- 1:100 / 101 * 2 * pi
y <- sin(x) + .2 * rnorm(100)
out <- trendfilter(y, x, nlambda = 15)
plot(out) +
  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = x, y = y), aes(x, y), color = "black")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? 
You can include R chunks like so:


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` 
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, 
so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
